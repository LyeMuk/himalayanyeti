                    </div>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>Former US President Mr. Obama in his book wrote about India's bureaucracy as an impediment in
                            its progress: “Despite its genuine economic progress, though, India remained a chaotic and
                            impoverished place: largely divided by religion and caste, captive to the whims of corrupt
                            local
                            officials and power brokers, hamstrung by a parochial bureaucracy that was resistant to
                            change.”
                            As a country, we don't want anyone's feedback on our bureaucracy and governance but the fact
                            is
                            that despite after 75 years of Independence:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1. Our bureaucrats remain corrupt, for instance, in Municipalities or any government
                                office,
                                until and unless you don't pay under the table, you will not be allotted a tender or
                                your work
                                will not be done.</li>
                            <li>2. The RFPs/RFQs and EOIs that is being floated are generally designed by the
                                influential
                                people, organizations and institutions that creates an entry barrier for smaller but
                                skilled
                                organizations and teams.</li>
                            <li>3. There is a huge gap between the skills and understanding of latest technologies,
                                subjects
                                etc. among these bureaucrats.
                                India needs a robust bureaucratic and governance mechanism so that policies can be
                                implemented
                                in a sound-manner on-ground.
                                HYF founding members faced immense issues while dealing with the low and mid-level
                                employees in
                                the government due to their laid-back approach and minimal understanding of various
                                challenges
                                that the entire CSR, ESG, or other industries are facing.</li>

                        <p>Not just the Government offices or bureaucrats but in-general corruption has become a major
                            issue in almost all the facets of life and businesses, for instance, professionals working
                            in the impact industry, certification and compliances industry, etc. are the role models for
                            the future generations but what if they start taking bribe to provide you certifications
                            without even implementing the best practices. Whom would you trust then? An organization?
                            Its processes? Or a piece of paper in a form of certificate?</p>
                        <p>
                            The trading mindset that India have given this corrupt ecosystem higher wings, no one wants
                            to put that extra efforts to realize value and potential from a product (or a waste
                            material/resource), but everyone is busy trading it for minimal but easy
                            margins/commissions, etc. They are the masters of bill trading, and compliments this corrupt
                            system amazingly.</p>

                            We at HYF if won’t be able to fight with them, at least we will safeguard ourselves and will
                            not compromise our ethics for business, as for us it is not business but a sustainable and

                        <p>Believe it or not, but the founding members of HYF are crazy about the impact that they can
                            create, for instance, Shivam Batra (co-founder HYF), left his well-paid job in Africa, moved
                            to Milan, Italy to pursue MBA (International Sustainable and Circular Businesses), after
                            which he decided to move to India to actually create viable impact rather than staying in
                            Europe and working there.</p>
                        <p>
                            Shivam Batra since then has been working on-ground and managing complex projects related to
                            ESG, EPR, Circular Economy, CSR, etc. and is a well-known face in the Indian waste
                            management and recycling industry. He is a keynote speaker and delivers world-class lectures
                            on the above-mentioned subjects.</p>
                        <p>
                            He is one such example in HYF, our entire team is formulated based upon hunger to make
                            change, we don’t believe in number of years of experience, but seconds/minutes and hours of
                            impact a person in her or his life has created.</p>

                    <div class="details">
                        <p>This is something that needs no explanation, but, more than the issues we should be focussing
                            on identifying right solutions and skills to solve it. The problems that we see in matters
                            related to ESG are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                1. Most of the investors/businesses are focussing on seeing sustainability from a
                                macro-lens, i.e., carbon emissions, water footprints, packaging related issues, social
                                benefits for the workers, etc. A very crucial “G” i.e., Governance is something that is
                                being left behind among all the “E” Environmental and “S” Social Issues.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. Quite often professionals are confused among corporate social responsibility i.e.,
                                CSR, and ESG and or Circular Economy initiatives, and they club them together. CSR and
                                Sustainability should be seen very differently as sustainable initiatives are something
                                that should be taken across the value-chain in the operations (be it downstream,
                                mid-stream or upstream).
                            </li>

                                3. The skills required to solve such complex issues are still developing and lot of
                                young people are entering into this side of the business, but again the level of
                                understanding and maturity that is required to solve these issues, is still not there.

                                4. Most of the senior-management people comes from either communications or PR/Marketing
                                background thus, making it a greenwashing and branding exercise rather than the actual
                                impact.

                        <p>HYF was born because of such issues and we believe we would be able to solve each one of them
                            in the projects we do and the collaborations/partnerships we make in the future.</p>
